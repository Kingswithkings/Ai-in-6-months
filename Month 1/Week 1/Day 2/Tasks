# 2 Tuple Element Change
# When you try to change an element in a tuple, a TypeError occurs because tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
colours = ('yellow', 'purple', 'blue')
colours = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
# This will cause a TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# colours[0] = 'yellow'

# 3 Unique Letters in a Set
# A set stores unique elements. By converting a astring to a set, duplicate letters are automatically removed.

letters_set = set(word)
print(f"Unique letters: {letters_set}")
print(f"Number of unique letters: {len(letters_set)}")

# 4 Student Dictionary
# You can add new key-value pairs to an existing dictionary. Here, a new key passed is added with a boolean value.

    'grade': 'A'
}

# Add a new key to the dictionary
student['passed'] = True
